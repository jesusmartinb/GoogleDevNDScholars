			<p>The cheetah owes its enormous speed to its huge strides, which allow it to cover a lot of ground at each step. It has very long legs, and the length of its stride increases thanks to a flexible column. When it runs at high speed, it is bent so that the hind legs advance; then it stretches in the opposite direction to get that huge stride.</p>
